    The coronavirus disease(COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus. Coronavirus has affected the day to day life of many people around the world. This pandemic has affected thousands of people, who are either sick or are being killed due to the spread of this disease. The most common symptoms of this viral infection are fever, cold, cough, bone pain and breathing problems, and ultimately leading to pneumonia. Since it is such a new disease, there hasn't been a vaccine developed until now. 
    During this pandemic, many people all over the world have lost their jobs because business were forced to shut down. With all of these people out of their jobs, we would like to provide donation to those who are currently unemployed. To make a donation, please visit our Donate page.
